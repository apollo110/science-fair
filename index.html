                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Let’s look at some basics. A calorie represents the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. One kilocalorie is 1000 calories. In the context of human physiology, calories serve as the unit of energy that our bodies utilize for various processes and physical activities. This energy is obtained through the consumption of food and drink, which are metabolized by the body to release energy for cellular functions, growth, and movement. Burning calories is essential for maintaining energy balance and achieving optimal health outcomes. When caloric intake exceeds how much you spend, the excess energy is stored as fat, leading to weight gain over time. On the other hand, when energy expenditure exceeds intake, stored fat is utilized for fuel, resulting in weight loss. Therefore, the regulation of caloric balance is critical for managing body weight and preventing obesity-related health complications. Aerobic exercises are sustained, rhythmic movements that elevate heart rate and oxygen consumption, highly effective for burning calories. Examples include running, cycling, and swimming, which engage large muscle groups and stimulate the cardiovascular system to increase energy expenditure. Calisthenics, such as bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges, also contribute to calorie burning by promoting muscle strength and endurance. Additionally, strength training activities, involving resistance exercises like weightlifting or resistance band workouts, enhance muscle mass and metabolic rate, leading to greater calorie expenditure both during and after exercise sessions. Incorporating a balanced regimen of aerobic, calisthenics, and strength training exercises is crucial for optimizing calorie burning, promoting weight management, and supporting overall health and fitness.</p>

                <h2>Prediction</h2>
                <p>We predict that weightlifting will burn more calories than running and lunges. This is based on the understanding that weightlifting requires significant effort from muscles, leading to a higher calorie outflow during the workout. While running and lunges are effective forms of exercise, they target cardiovascular fitness while, weight lifting's capacity to engage multiple muscle groups intensively suggests it will result in a greater overall calorie burn. </p>

            <section id="conclusion" class="hoverable">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In our experiment comparing calorie burns across different exercises, running unexpectedly outperformed weightlifting in terms of calorie expenditure during a 10-minute session. Despite our initial assumption that weightlifting's muscle-focused activity would yield higher calorie burns, the data told a different story. Running engaged both the legs and arms more dynamically, leading to a higher calorie burn in the short timeframe. This aligns with existing research highlighting running's effectiveness as a calorie-burning exercise. For example, studies consistently show that running at a moderate pace significantly elevates oxygen consumption compared to weightlifting, indicating a higher calorie burn. Thus, our experiment's results, combined with scientific evidence, emphasize the effectiveness of running for burning calories efficiently, even within short timeframes.</p>
                <p>We also found that because Austin and Ben had a higher body weight, they burnt way more calories than Adithya. This is because they have a bigger body to tend to essentially as their bigger body needs more oxygen to function which means they have a higher metabolism.</p>

            <section id="evaluation" class="hoverable">
                <h2>Evaluation</h2>
                <p>In evaluating our experiment, we found no glaring anomalies in the data collected. However, upon closer examination, Austin's results stood out—he burned the second most calories while weightlifting, while Adithya and Ben burned the least during this activity. This inconsistency prompts consideration of several factors that may have influenced these outcomes. Firstly, Austin's higher body weight could have contributed to his higher calorie expenditure, as individuals with greater mass often have higher metabolic rates. Additionally, variations in fitness levels among participants could have played a role, with Austin potentially possessing a different level of fitness compared to Adithya and Ben. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge potential limitations in our experiment. One notable consideration is the use of Fitbit or smartwatch devices to measure calorie expenditure, which may not provide entirely accurate readings. These devices rely on algorithms and sensor data to estimate calorie burn, and while they offer convenient tracking, they may not capture individual physiological differences or account for the intensity and form of exercises accurately. To address these potential limitations and improve the fairness of future experiments, several adjustments could be implemented. Increasing the sample size of our experiment could provide us with better results. However, we think our results are already pretty reliable as we repeated it twice among three people.</p>
